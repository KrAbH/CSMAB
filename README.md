Simulation of CSMAB in different settings.
In this project we aim to show the efficacy our an UCB based algorithm CS-UCB is combinatorial sleeping setting MAB. We have considered a general reward function in our formulation. 

data_prep.py -> This file generates the mean of bernoulli random variable to express the reward and sleeping nature of each arm. This file generates the data and dumps into two files. 

Following are the reward functions
