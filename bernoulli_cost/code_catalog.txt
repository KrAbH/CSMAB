To generate true mu values, mean of availability and cost of each arm, 
Run -> python data_prep_BerC.py <number of arms> 

This will generate 3 files which contains mu values (mu_*.txt), mean of availability (availability_*.txt) and cost of each arm (cost_*.txt), where * is replaced by number of arms. 

CS-UCB, where arms with positive (mu - cost) reward is selected is implemented in csucb_BerC.py
To run the algorithm write the following command:
python csucb_BerC.py N T k
where, 
N is number of epochs
T is number of rounds in one epoch
k is number of arms

This evaluates regret and stores in file as "out_k5_N2_T1000.txt". Here, k=5, N=2 and T=1000.
